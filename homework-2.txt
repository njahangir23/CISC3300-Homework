3. Flexbox and CSS Grid are both useful layout systems in CSS, but they serve different purposes and have unique 
characteristics. Here’s a breakdown of their similarities and differences:Both Flexbox and CSS Grid are designed 
to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. They both simplify complex layouts compared 
to older methods (like floats or positioning), making it easier to align and distribute space between elements.
However, flexbox is a one-dimensional, it deals with layouts in a single direction—either as a row or a column. 
It’s great for aligning items within a single line and on a smaller scale. Items are laid out in the order they 
appear in the source code. It can rearrange them with properties like order, but it still follows a flow. The 
properties used with flexbox are: flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, and align-items.
On the other hand, CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout. It allows for layout in both rows and columns simultaneously, 
making it ideal for creating complex grid structures.Because of this, the CSS grid is better suited for larger layouts, 
such as overall page structures. You can define rows and columns and place items into specific grid areas. You can 
position items anywhere in the grid using grid lines, allowing for more complex designs without changing the HTML 
structure. CSS Grid utilizes properties like grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, and grid-area, giving you 
more control over the layout structure.
