1. In certain programming languages the source code is not directly translated by the target
machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code,
this is called an ________ language.------------------------------------------------------interpreted

2. Type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to
change over its lifetime, this is called ________ typing.------------------------------------dynamic

3. JS for web browser work doesnâ€™t tend to use classes to make objects, and is written in a

4. Variables that are block scoped, not declarable use the keyword ________------------------var

5. ________ determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.--------------------------scope

6. Variables assigned with the ________ keyword are block scoped and not redeclarable.------const

7. Functions that can be passed as an argument to another function and called later are
called ________.----------------------------------------------------------------------------callback functions

8. Non primitive data types are (almost)all technically ________ in memory.-----------------objects

Notes:
- Javascript handles the dynamic functionality on the web page
- C++ is a complied language, Javascript is a interpreted language
- JS doesn't use classes to make objects 
- Method: a verb in programming, a function in the context of an object is a Method
- Script---->interpreted language
- Window is the browser, global object
- Docuement is the html file, global object
- 'this' keyword always refers to an object
