1.HTML stands for hypertext markup language. It is a markup language which uses a set of rules that define the structure
  and presentation of text and images on a digital document. 
  
2.CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is used to design and style web pages such  as changing color, fonts styles
  and sizes. CSS gives rules to different HTML elements.  

3.The Fordham website first welcomes it's user with a banner of the Rose Hill campus. Within this banner, there are
  different boxes that divide the user's attention, they contain news about Fordham and important updates/events around
  the campus. The biggest box in the banner is filled the most important news, making sure the user sees it and engages 
  with it. At the top,a navigation bar provides quick access to key areas such as Admissions, Academics, Student Life, 
  and Research. This horizontal menu helps users easily find information relevant to their interests or needs. After the 
  banner, the websites' content area is divided into sections with clear headings and subheadings, often accompanied by 
  images or icons that help break up the text and make the page more visually appealing. There is a video and a inter-
  active calendar, allowing Fordham to draw in the user more with different elements. Overall, the website’s structured 
  layout and intuitive navigation options are designed to guide users efficiently to the information they need while 
  showcasing the university’s key messages and offerings.

4.An HTML element is a collection of start and end tags with code between them. They are the building blocks of a webpage.
  Tags in HTML act like containers, they tell the the browser something about the information inbetween the tags, this is
  the idea of markup being employeed in HTML. Example: opening tag: <p> and closing tag </p>. And HTML attribute tells 
  the browser more about the content of the element. They have names and values.

5.A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. 
  p{        ------> 'p' is the selector, indicates which element the rule has to apply to.
    color: blue  -> the declaration how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled, has a porperty and value.
  }

6.CSS rules cascade by specificity, if a selector is more descriptive/specific than the other one, the more specific will
  tkae precedence over the more general one. Another way CSS rules cascade is by the order in which they appear in the
  the code. If two selectors are the same, the latter one will take precedence. Another way CSS rules cascade is by 
  adding the '!important' after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other
  rules that apply to the same element.

8.When submitting an HTML form, the default behavior is to send the form data to the server specified in the form's
